          </h5>

          <p>
            E-By Design Technologies Inc. is the proud provider of fully
            automated solutions “for the price of two stamps.” This commitment
            to value means we sometimes need to sunset products that are no
            longer viable. We do this to ensure our systems are secure,
            available, and maintain their integrity for the safety of all users
            relying on these systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have announced the end of technical support for Triton Advantage
            build 20220830.2 and below, effective from October 31, 2022. After
            every major release, we support legacy releases for a period of time
            to help our customers upgrade to the latest build. We recommend
            customers upgrade to the latest build to get the full benefit of
            security features and technical support.

            FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

          <ol>
            <li>
              <h5>What does <i>End of technical support</i> mean?</h5>
              <p>
                End of technical support means technical assistance will not be
                available for the specified builds past the retirement dates.
                However, our engineers will assist you in upgrading to the
                latest build provided:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  You have a valid agreement to use of the software (Fee per use
                  of licensed or sub license software installs)
                </li>
                <li>
                  You have a valid Maintenance contract (Maintenance agreement
                  for technical services)
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h5>Why is this build no longer supported?</h5>

              <p>
                Many software vendors include maintenance costs built into the
                cost of software licenses. Typically, businesses pay a
                percentage of total license costs on a monthly or yearly basis
                (known as maintenance costs) to keep the application in warranty
                and guarantee regular system upgrades. Paying these fees means
                you never have to worry about losing support for your system as
                it will be regularly upgraded once new versions are released.
              </p>
              <p>
                As with any business investment, the cost to implement a new
                software system will be significant, so make sure you look at
                all your options and not just upgrade to the latest version of
                the system you’re on. Be prepared to make the investment and
                consider systems that offer maintenance programs which will give
                you access to regular upgrades in the future in order to keep up
                with the latest versions and technology. End of support does not
                have to be a bad thing – take it as an opportunity to improve
                your processes and grow your business!

            <li>
              <h5>Why should I upgrade?</h5>
              <p>
                Your organization’s business success relies on your ability to
                maintain trustworthy systems. Your organization should identify,
                report, and correct information system flaws and vulnerabilities
                as soon as possible. Patch management is your strategy and
                process for acquiring, validating, testing, and installing
                patches and upgrades on your systems and devices.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h5>Is the upgrade done free of cost?</h5>
              <p>
                All customers in good standing and under a valid AMS contract
                are eligible for upgrades at no additional cost.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h5>
                My Triton Advantage contract has terminated or expired. How can
                I upgrade?
              </h5>

              <p>
                You have to renew your contract before upgrading. Please write
                to admin@e-bydesign.ca for a renewal price offer.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h5>How long will you provide support for older builds?</h5>

              <p>
                Support will be provided for older builds (mentioned above)
                until the end of the support date.
